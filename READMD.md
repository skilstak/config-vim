## FAQ

*Why no NeoVim?*

Because it is stupid and worthless if you use TMUX (which you should) configured with Vim bindings. I mean, who the hell wants to write plugins in Lua? *Pfff.*

*Let me try that again in my politically-correcter-er voice.*

Because it provides no additional benefit beyond that already provided by Vim -- especially when combined with a terminal multiplexer such as `screen` or `tmux`, which we believe all terminal masters should learn as a matter of course. Moreover, encourage further use of *vim script* promotes a non-divided ecosystem of plugins, which are at the core of Vim productivity and adaptability. To suggest another language is needed for such plugins only fractures the development effort unnecessarily.
